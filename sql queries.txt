	a. SELECT name FROM `action` order by name
	b. SELECT t2.name,t3.name,count(t1.id) as total
		FROM permission t1
		left join page t2 on t1.page_id = t2.id
		left join action t3 on t1.action_id = t3.id
		group by t1.page_id,t1.action_id
		
		*join is for name sake only, could have used permission table only with ids as identifiers:
		SELECT page_id,action_id,count(id) as total
		FROM permission
		group by page_id,action_id
	c. SELECT t4.name,t2.name,t3.name from permission t1
		left join page t2 on t1.page_id = t2.id
		left join action t3 on t1.action_id = t3.id
		left join user t4 on t1.user_id = t4.id
		where action_id not in(
			SELECT action_id from permission 
			where user_id = Y)
		and user_id = X
		* again joins are only for naming sake and readability purposes
